# How to use reloader to automatically reload Deployment or another object when ConfigMap or Secret change

### Install Reloader in Kubernetes Cluster
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stakater/Reloader/master/deployments/kubernetes/reloader.yaml
```
Apply this on `default` namespace in kubernetes cluster.\
Then reloader will watch in all namespaces.

### Apply annotation in Deployment/Statefulset or etch to use Reloader
For a `Deployment` called `foo` have a `ConfigMap` called `foo-configmap` or `Secret` called `foo-secret` or both. Then add your annotation (by default `reloader.stakater.com/auto`) to main metadata of your `Deployment`

```yaml
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    reloader.stakater.com/auto: "true"
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
```

This will discover deploymentconfigs/deployments/daemonsets/statefulset/rollouts automatically where `foo-configmap` or `foo-secret` is being used either via environment variable or from volume mount. And it will perform rolling upgrade on related pods when `foo-configmap` or `foo-secret`are updated.

You can restrict this discovery to only `ConfigMap` or `Secret` objects that
are tagged with a special annotation. To take advantage of that, annotate
your deploymentconfigs/deployments/daemonsets/statefulset/rollouts like this:

```yaml
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    reloader.stakater.com/search: "true"
spec:
  template:
```

and Reloader will trigger the rolling upgrade upon modification of any
`ConfigMap` or `Secret` annotated like this:

```yaml
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  annotations:
    reloader.stakater.com/match: "true"
data:
  key: value
```

provided the secret/configmap is being used in an environment variable, or a
volume mount.

Please note that `reloader.stakater.com/search` and
`reloader.stakater.com/auto` do not work together. If you have the
`reloader.stakater.com/auto: "true"` annotation on your deployment, then it
will always restart upon a change in configmaps or secrets it uses, regardless
of whether they have the `reloader.stakater.com/match: "true"` annotation or
not.

We can also specify a specific configmap or secret which would trigger rolling upgrade only upon change in our specified configmap or secret, this way, it will not trigger rolling upgrade upon changes in all configmaps or secrets used in a `deploymentconfig`, `deployment`, `daemonset`, `statefulset` or `rollout`.
To do this either set the auto annotation to `"false"` (`reloader.stakater.com/auto: "false"`) or remove it altogether, and use annotations for [Configmap](.#Configmap) or [Secret](.#Secret).

### Configmap

To perform rolling upgrade when change happens only on specific configmaps use below annotation.

For a `Deployment` called `foo` have a `ConfigMap` called `foo-configmap`. Then add this annotation to main metadata of your `Deployment`

```yaml
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    configmap.reloader.stakater.com/reload: "foo-configmap"
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
```

Use comma separated list to define multiple configmaps.

```yaml
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    configmap.reloader.stakater.com/reload: "foo-configmap,bar-configmap,baz-configmap"
spec:
  template: 
    metadata:
```

### Secret

To perform rolling upgrade when change happens only on specific secrets use below annotation.

For a `Deployment` called `foo` have a `Secret` called `foo-secret`. Then add this annotation to main metadata of your `Deployment`

```yaml
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    secret.reloader.stakater.com/reload: "foo-secret"
spec:
  template: 
    metadata:
```

Use comma separated list to define multiple secrets.

```yaml
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    secret.reloader.stakater.com/reload: "foo-secret,bar-secret,baz-secret"
spec:
  template: 
    metadata:
```
